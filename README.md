**React Developer Task**

Task: Build a Mini "Task Tracker"

Requirements:

1. Display a list of tasks (title, due date, status).

2. Allow adding/editing/deleting tasks (modal or inline edit).

3. Tasks should persist (mock API).

4. Filter tasks by status (All, Pending, Done).

5. Use React Hooks, not class components.

6. Styling with plain CSS or Tailwind (no UI library like MUI).

P.S. write thoughtful component design, Add debounce search, Add a simple sorting feature (by date or name)
